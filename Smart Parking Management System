Parking Management System

Description:
Our Parking Management System is a Java-based application designed to efficiently manage parking lots in various establishments such as malls, airports, or office buildings. It offers a user-friendly interface for both parking attendants and customers, ensuring smooth operations and optimal space utilization.

Key Features:

Slot Allocation: Users can specify the total number of parking slots available, and the system dynamically manages the allocation of slots based on incoming and outgoing vehicles.
Easy Parking: Attendants can quickly park vehicles by entering the license plate number, and the system automatically assigns an available slot, optimizing parking space utilization.
Vehicle Retrieval: Customers can easily retrieve their vehicles by providing the license plate number, and the system guides attendants to the respective slot for efficient retrieval.
Real-Time Updates: The system provides real-time updates on available parking slots, helping customers make informed decisions and reducing waiting times.
Error Handling: Robust error handling ensures that users are notified of any invalid inputs or system failures, maintaining a seamless parking experience.
Code Implementation:

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("Enter the total number of parking slots:");
        totalSlots = sc.nextInt();
        availableSlots = totalSlots;

        while (true) {
            System.out.println("\nWhat would you like to do?");
            System.out.println("1. Park a car");

            }
        }
    }

    public static void parkCar() {
        if (availableSlots == 0) {
            System.out.println("Sorry, there are no available parking slots.");
            return;
        }

        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("Enter the license plate number of the car:");
        String licensePlate = sc.nextLine();
        parkedCars.add(licensePlate);
        availableSlots--;
        System.out.println("Car parked successfully. Available slots: " + availableSlots);
    }

    public static void removeCar() {

            System.out.println("There are no parked cars.");
            return;
        }

        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("Enter the license plate number of the car to be removed:");
        String licensePlate = sc.nextLine();
        if (parkedCars.contains(licensePlate)) {
            parkedCars.remove(licensePlate);
            availableSlots++;
            System.out.println("Car removed successfully. Available slots: " + availableSlots);
        } else {
            System.out.println("The car is not parked here.");
        }
    }

    public static void viewParkedCars() {
        if (availableSlots == totalSlots) {
            System.out.println("There are no parked cars.");
            return;
        }

        System.out.println("Parked cars:");
        for (String licensePlate : parkedCars) {
            System.out.println(licensePlate);
        }
